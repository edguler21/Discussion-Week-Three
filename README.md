# Discussion-Week-Three
# In Java, both arrays and ArrayLists are used to store collections of data, but they differ significantly in structure, functionality, and use cases.
# An array is a fixed-size data structure that holds elements of the same data type. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. Arrays are efficient terms of performance because they allow direct access to elements using indexes. They are best used when the number of elements is known and does not change.
# An ArrayList, part of the Java Collections Framework, is a resizable array. It can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. ArrayLists are more flexible but slightly less efficient than arrays because they involve more overhead due to dynamic resizing and object management.
